#  📥  BallotGuide

## Motivation
Local elections have some of the lowest turnout, even though they shape the policies people feel every day.

- In the 100 largest U.S. cities, average mayoral-election turnout was **20.2%**, and **73 of 100 cities were below 25%** turnout. [1]
- Local governments control spending and policy areas tied to daily life, including schools, public safety, transportation, housing, and water infrastructure. [2]
- Climate is local too: urban systems account for **67-72%** of global greenhouse gas emissions, and local land use + transportation choices are key mitigation levers. [3][4]

Our goal: make ballots understandable and personally relevant so more people vote with confidence.

## What We Built
BallotGuide translates opaque ballot language into clear, source-grounded explanations about what each choice means for a voter's real life.

- Personalized, plain-English ballot annotations with citations
- Candidate and policy context grounded in real local legislation
- A budget-impact experience that shows predicted spending shifts by category
- A 3D city interface where policy markers are pinned to real places

## Technical Highlights

- Built a Pinecone vector database with **30,000+ scraped embeddings** from real local legislation and legal code.
- Added a **Dedalus agent pipeline** that queries the vector database first, then returns grounded explanations with reliable source links.
- Trained a **regression model on budget data** to predict category deltas that drive the interactive pie chart experience.
- Integrated real **3D city models** and used our agent + geo metadata to drop location-based policy annotations directly on the map.
